Suppose the following array has been declared:
// index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
int[] list = {–2, 8, 13, 22, 25, 25, 38, 42, 51, 103};
What indexes will be examined as the middle element by a
binary search for each of the following target values? What
value will be returned?
a. 103
b. 30
c. 8
d. –1

Answer:
a.103: middle index 9 (value = 103, which is the target value)
b.30: cannot be found, return -1
c.8: middle index 1 (value = 8)
d.-1: cannot be found, return -1
